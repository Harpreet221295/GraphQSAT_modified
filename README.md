This is a modified version of the Graph-QSAT which is created from the original source code. The purpose of this project was to review, analyze, reproduce the original results and perform additional experimentation for <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11830">Can Q-Learning with Graph Networks Learn a Generalizable Branching Heuristic for a SAT Solver?</a> 

To run:
unzip data.zip in the same directory and open the GraphQSAT_driver_code.ipynb in Google Colab and run the cells.



###This Project is part of cse 257: Search and Optimization course at UCSD taken during Spring 2021.
